# nn.c
Neural Networks from scratch in C.

*Any function allocating memory on the heap ends with an underscore '_'.*\
*The pointers returned by these must be freed by their associated functions.*

For now the functions derivatives are derived by hand but I plan on building an autograd engine soon too.

For the optimizer for now we always use SGD.
